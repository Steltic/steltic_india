pipeline.py  --  the design entry point the agent runs. ONE straight-through call (NO user-review
pause). Do NOT hand-write report.html or your own model/design scripts.

    import pipeline
    name = "<the building name the user gave you>"
    res = pipeline.design_and_report(name, cfg)    # sanity -> DEMAND envelope -> figures -> report.html
    print(res)                                     # {model_valid, demands_written, figures, report_html, design_dir, root}

You DETERMINE the joints / base fixity explicitly and STATE them in the report, but you do NOT pause
to ask the user to approve the model. (build_and_preview(name, cfg) remains available as an OPTIONAL
self-review that builds just the 3 figures -- it is not a required hold.)

The framework computes the model, the IS loads from cfg['load_plan'] (RAG), the P-Delta analysis, and the per-member
DEMANDS + the report scaffold. It computes NO IS 800 capacity: YOU query the RAG, derive every
capacity/D-C yourself, and write them into calc_package.json. All outputs go to the building's
solution folder: steel_builder/<name>/ (design/, figs/, report.html).

Unusual geometry / non-rigid joints: the parametric builder makes a rectangular grid of rigid
elasticBeamColumn members. To model anything else (custom nodes, sloped roofs, per-member moment
releases, etc.), set cfg["custom_build"] = a function custom_build(cfg, transf) that builds the
OpenSees model and returns the standard info dict {cm, present, z, NF, ele:[(tag,kind,sec,n1,n2)]}
using engine3d.ntag(i,j,k)/mtag(k); the whole pipeline then runs on your model unchanged.
