"""The escalation ladder in `search_engineering_standards`: when it climbs, and when it stops.

The ladder was written to fire on a zero-hit answer. On 2026-09-18 a design run showed the gap that
leaves: a nine-term query at IS 360-22 matched exactly ONE chunk -- a fragment straddling the
E7/F2 boundary -- and one hit is not zero, so the ladder never ran and the agent was handed a
fragment as though it were Chapter F. A thin rung now keeps the ladder climbing, and the best rung
seen is what comes back, labelled thin, rather than a claim that the provision is absent.

Engine-free and server-free: the RAG is a stub. Run with `python -m pytest tests -q` from the root.
